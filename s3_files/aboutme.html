            About Me
            Hello! I'm George Wettlaufer, a junior tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in Amazon Web Services
            (AWS). I am
            passionate about cloud computing and eager to grow my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field.<br><br>

            I have been working with Amazon Web Services, learning how to manage cloud infrastructure and deploy
            scalable solutions. My experience with AWS has given me a solid understanding of creating secure, efficient,
            and cost-effective cloud environments. I am proficient in services such as EC2, S3, RDS, and Lambda, and I
            am constantly expanding my knowledge of the AWS ecosystem.<br><br>

            I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends. My approach is
            collaborative and detail-oriented, always aiming for excellence in every project I undertake.<br><br>


            Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy running, coding, anything with computers.
            These activities keep me balanced and inspired. <br><br>

            Get in Touch
            I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me or connect with me on
            LinkedIn, GitHub, or other platforms. <br><br>
